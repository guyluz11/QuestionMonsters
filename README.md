# QuestionMonsters

This is console based game that I wrote to practice oop and writing Unit tests.

This game getting the questions from this api https://opentdb.com/ .


Before starting the game the player decide the question topic and difficulty.

In the game the player goes on an adventure and incounter monsters, inorder to deal damage and defet them he need to answer questions, and each time that he win the monsters are getting stronger and the player have lass time to answer each question.

The game accompanied with random soundtrack from the music folder to make atmosphere of adventure.

Have fun and good luck ðŸŒ‹.
